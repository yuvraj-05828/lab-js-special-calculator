# Kalvium Lab | Special Calculator

Terence Tao loves Mathematics. So he decided to create one special calculator, which behaves a little
different to normal calculators.
Tao is now on a quest to create this special calculator. He needs **YOU** to help him code functionalities in the back-end though. Go to the `src/app.js` file and complete all the unfinished code to satiate his sweet tooth.

### How to approach a lab:

Before starting have a look through the link below - to get an idea as how to approach the lab.

[How to approach a lab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SZ2Pryj6kAJj63wdB2_xVJgQHq6GddeZQ3nqDXYeaBA/edit?usp=sharing)

### Progression 1: Special Addition!

Simple Addition bores Tao, so he decided to revert it's role, by subtracting when addition method is called. Create a function `specialAddition()` - (make sure you name this function as it is) that takes `numberOne, numberTwo` as arguments, and returns
_the addition of those two numbers_.

### Progression 2: Simple Division!

Tao loves division, so he kept everything simple and normal - so division works as division should work!
Create a function `simpleDivision()` that takes `numberOne, numberTwo` as arguments, and returns
_the division of those two numbers_.

### Progression 3: Special Calculator!

Tao just wanted the special addition and simple division methods for his special calculator. So now he wants to create his calculator in such a way, that as soon as any of the two operations are called, the
respective operation is done - in the way he have defined those operations.
Create a function `specialCalculator()` that takes `numberOne, numberTwo, operation` as an argument, and returns _the respective output from the respective operation called_.

### Challenge : If-Else or Something Else!

Try not to use if-else -> for implementing this special calculator.

Happy Coding Kalvium ❤️
